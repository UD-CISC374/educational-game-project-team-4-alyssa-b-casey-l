# Overview

## Elevator Pitch

You are a despondent delivery driver working at a fast food restaurant where you have to prepare customer's orders and deliver them on your bike. Occasionally, customer's will give you orders in Spanish or French and it is your mission to deliver the best fast food experience possible. You will have to match food names to the appropriate item, and identify which language a word is in. This game is meant for 5th and 6th graders to introduce them to basic words in Spanish and French. Our game will have multiple levels, beginning with English, having the target language in parentheses, and transitioning to the target language with no English.

## Influences (Brief)

- Drinks Maker: Coffee Shop Juice Tycoon:
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: The game idea stemmed from a tycoon-esque simulator. The exact one was not thought of so an arbitrary one was selected.
- Uber Eats:
  - Medium: Delivery Service
  - Explanation: The idea of a game that simulates being an Uber Eats/Door Dash/Postmates etc. deliverer seemed amusing and a good way to integrate directional instructions into the vocabulary of the game.
- Rosetta Stone:
  - Medium: Software
  - Explanation: There was a slight frustration surrounding the concept of Rosetta Stone not being a "fun enough" way to learn. The learning integration could be more enjoyable in a gaming environment, rather than an environment geared towards learning.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click and drag ingredients from the conveyor belt to the delivery bag.
- Click on the ingredient that aligns with the corresponding vocabulary term.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

## Prerequisite Knowledge


- Identify and match various food items to their English name.

## Assessment Measures

A short multiple choice post quiz will be provided at the end of the game to measure recognition of vocabulary.

# What sets this project apart?

- Introduction courses rely heavily on memorization of basic vocabulary, this game will challenge the player to both complete the game and allow the player to learn new vocabulary through incremental integration of a foreign language.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a single player game where the player clicks and drags items from the conveyor belt into the customer's bag.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Click and drag ingredients from the conveyor belt to the delivery bag: You can click on different food items going along the conveyor belt and add them by dragging them to the bag. You can drag items back and forth before placing them in the bag.
- Click on the ingredient that aligns with the corresponding vocabulary term: You have to add ingredients to the bag based on the vocab term by clicking and dragging item from the conveyor belt to the order bag. If the incorrect ingredient is added to the bag (whether it be an extra item or incorrect item) it will be removed upon the quality check (determinent of game advancement) and the player will have to fix the order by adding the correct items.


    
## Feedback

- Adding the correct item to the bag adds a check mark to the checklist and an increase in score (+5).

# Story and Gameplay

- A speech bubble from your boss that says "Click and drag items" at the beginning of the food stage.

## Presentation of Content

The game intends to teach basic vocab in the target language by showing a picture of the item and the name in English for the first level, then the picture and name in the target language for the next level, and finally just the name of the item in the target language. Same for the directions.
