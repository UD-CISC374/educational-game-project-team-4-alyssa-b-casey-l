# Overview

## Elevator Pitch

You are a despondent delivery driver working at a fast food restaurant where you have to prepare customer's orders and deliver them on your bike. Occasionally, customer's will give you orders in Spanish or French and it is your mission to deliver the best fast food experience possible. You are given food/direction labels with pictures to follow to help you accomplish this mission.

## Influences (Brief)

- Drinks Maker: Coffee Shop Juice Tycoon:
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: The game idea stemmed from a tycoon-esque simulator. The exact one was not thought of so an arbitrary one was selected.
- Uber Eats:
  - Medium: Delivery Service
  - Explanation: The idea of a game that simulates being an Uber Eats/Door Dash/Postmates etc. deliverer seemed amusing and a good way to integrate directional instructions into the vocabulary of the game.
- Rosetta Stone:
  - Medium: Software
  - Explanation: There was a slight frustration surrounding the concept of Rosetta Stone not being a "fun enough" way to learn. The learning integration could be more enjoyable in a gaming environment, rather than an environment geared towards learning.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Click and drag ingredients from the conveyor belt to the delivery bag.
- Use the arrow keys to follow directions to get to the destination.
- Click on the ingredient that aligns with the corresponding vocabulary term.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

- Introduction to Spanish and French

## Target Audiences

- Upper level grade school students (tentatively 5th/6th grade students).

## Target Contexts

- This would be assigned as supplementary practice in a course formally teaching introductory Spanish and/or French vocabulary.

## Learning Objectives

- Match food names to appropriate item.
- Identify and follow directional instructions based on the language integration.
- Identify which language a word is in.

## Prerequisite Knowledge


- Identify and match various food items to their English name.
- Identify and match various directions from Spanish and/or French to their English name.

## Assessment Measures

A short multiple choice post quiz will be provided at the end of the game to measure recognition of vocabulary.

# What sets this project apart?

- Introduction courses rely heavily on memorization of basic vocabulary, this game will challenge the player to both complete the game and allow the player to learn new vocabulary through incremental integration of a foreign language.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a single player game where the player clicks and drags items from the conveyor belt into the customer's bag. The user will then use arrow keys to direct the character in the right direction.

## Player Modes

- Single player: you repeatedly advance through rounds and levels until you reach the end.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Prepare the customer's order correctly:
    - Description: Read the customers' order and properly prepare it/deliver it to them.
    - Alignment: Match food names to appropriate item.
- Advance to the next level:
    - Description: Get 4 rounds correct to advance to the next level
    - Alignment: Match food names to appropriate item. Identify and follow directional instructions based on the language integration. Identify which language a word is in.

# Procedures/Actions

You can click and drag (to translate food from the conveyor belt to the delivery bag) the cursor through regions of the screen.

You can use the arrow keys to direct the player towards their destination.

# Rules

- The player has to add the correct items to the bag, according to the checklist/customer's order; otherwise, there are points deducted at the end.
- The player has to direct themselves toward the customer's destination to deliver the food, otherwise they lose stars (points) and have an angry customer at the end.

# Objects/Entities

- The player
- Customer
- Conveyor belt
- Food
- Directional pictures
- Food labels
- Neighborhood
- Order bag
- Food checklist
- Bike

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Click and drag ingredients from the conveyor belt to the delivery bag: You can click on different food items going along the conveyor belt and add them by dragging them to the bag. You can drag items back and forth before placing them in the bag.
- Use the arrow keys to follow directions to get to the destination: You control your player on a bike trying to get to the customer's house, using arrow keys to follow the given directions. You can stop at the wrong house or go the wrong direction and lose points. You can turn around if you go the wrong way.
- Click on the ingredient that aligns with the corresponding vocabulary term: You have to add ingredients to the bag based on the vocab term by clicking and dragging item from the conveyor belt to the order bag. If the incorrect ingredient is added to the bag (whether it be an extra item or incorrect item) it will be removed upon the quality check (determinent of game advancement) and the player will have to fix the order by adding the correct items.


    
## Feedback

- Adding the correct item to the bag adds a check mark to the checklist; adding the wrong item adds an X to the list.
- Going in the wrong direction will cause you to lose either half a star or a whole star (out of 5).

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- A speech bubble from your boss that says "Click and drag items" at the beginning of the food stage; then he'll return at the beginning of the delivery stage to say "Use your arrow keys".

## Presentation of Content

The game intends to teach basic vocab in the target language by showing a picture of the item and the name in English for the first level, then the picture and name in the target language for the next level, and finally just the name of the item in the target language. Same for the directions.

## Story (Brief)

You work as a food delivery person trying to take customer's orders and delivery it to them based on the order's language.
