# Order Up!

An educational game by Alyssa Burks and Casey Ljuba for CISC374 Spring 2020

## About the game:

You are a despondent delivery driver working at a fast food restaurant where you have to prepare customer's orders and deliver them on your bike. Occasionally, customer's will give you orders in Spanish or French and it is your mission to deliver the best fast food experience possible. You will have to match food names to the appropriate item, and identify which language a word is in. This game is meant for 5th and 6th graders to introduce them to basic words in Spanish and French. Our game will have multiple levels, beginning with English, having the target language in parentheses, and transitioning to the target language with no English.

## How to play:

After reading the customer's order, you can click and drag the food into the delivery bag. Once you've completed the order, you're ready for the next round!
